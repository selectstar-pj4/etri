    "rationale": "The question is exo-centric: The tree is excluded because it is not a person, despite being the farthest from the thermos on the table. The fishing man is excluded because he is actually the closest to the thermos, positioned next to the sunbed woman. Therefore, the bicycle man is the correct answer as he is indeed the farthest from the thermos on the table, located to the right side of the image. Thus, the bicycle man is the answer.",
